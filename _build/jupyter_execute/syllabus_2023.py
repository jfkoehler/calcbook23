# ## Course Description
# 
# This course covers the content of a traditional first semester in Calculus with a focus on modeling. Topics include integration and differentiation, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, partial derivatives, tangent lines, optimization and basic differential equations. Applications of calculus and differential equations will be drawn from the social and natural sciences. Students will learn how to integrate numerical, geometric and analytic methods to solve problems, as well as to incorporate technology and mathematical software to compute, communicate, and visualize mathematics. This course is offered every spring and fulfills the second mathematics requirement for the Interdisciplinary Science major. It is also an option to fulfill the mathematics requirement for the Economics major.
